        Amidst the dark seas, and among the looming clouds. There we can find the quiet cries of many and the stares of others. There was a girl born 
        with a golden spoon in her mouth. From another side of the world, there was a boy born with rotten iron. The girl never skipped a meal, 
        she ate like a queen while the boy could only hope for a single grain of rice.

        Is the reality we aim to achieve? 
        Where food is deemed a privilege rather than a right?

    <h2> When two different worlds collide</h2>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px;">
        <p style="width: 700px;">
        As of May 2025, approximately 31,769,600 people in the Philippines are experiencing involuntary hunger—a staggering number that reflects 
        a deeply troubling reality. While many of us are able to enjoy meals without a second thought—sometimes even indulging in excess—millions 
        of our fellow Filipinos are struggling to find enough food to survive each day. This contrast is not just heartbreaking; it’s unacceptable.
        This website is more than just a source of information—it is a wake-up call. It’s a call to action for all of us to open our eyes, recognize 
        the severity of this crisis, and actively take part in making a difference. Whether through volunteering, donating, spreading awareness, or supporting community events aimed at hunger 
        relief, everyone has a role to play. We must remember that even the smallest act of kindness can create a ripple effect. Together, we can help bring food, dignity, and hope to those who need it most.

        <h5>What is Food Insecurity?</h5>
        <p>
            Many Americans shop for food with ease, but lower-income families often choose between bills and meals. Nutritious food is costly and hard to access in some areas. Tackling food insecurity means understanding its causes and working toward effective, lasting solutions.

        <h5>Food security: sufficient safe and healthy food for everyone</h5>
        <p>
            Food security means having consistent access to safe, healthy food that meets dietary needs for an active life. With 9.3 billion people to feed by 2050, improving food security will require reducing waste, enhancing infrastructure, and adopting more efficient production methods.
